    savings_text = "Charging an electric vehicles is <b>cheaper than fueling a gasoline car</b>. Therefore, the costs per mile are lower for electric vehicles than for gasoline cars. The savings are calculated by comparing electricity prices with gas prices and the efficiency of electric vehicles with traditional cars. <b>The value presented tells you how much you can save with this electric car for every 100 miles compared to gasoline and diesl vehicles.</b>"
    new_used_text = "This attribute specifies whether the electric car is being sold <b>as a new or used vehicle</b>.

Each gallon of gasoline and diesel burned produces CO2, so the carbon tax would increase the price of these fuels.
